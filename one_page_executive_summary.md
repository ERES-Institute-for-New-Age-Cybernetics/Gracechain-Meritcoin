# One-Page Pitch: Joseph A. Sprute → Anthropic Collaboration

---

## Who I Am

**Systems architect** with millennium-scale frameworks for AI governance, alternative economics, and civilizational coordination. Founder of ERES Institute of New Age Cybernetics. Published researcher exploring intersections of AI safety, bio-cybernetics, and long-horizon planning.

---

## The Problem I Solve for Anthropic

You're building powerful AI that will reshape civilization. But:
- **Governance frameworks** don't exist for deploying AI across diverse stakeholders
- **Economic disruption** from AI automation lacks viable transition models
- **Alignment horizons** rarely extend beyond 50 years (civilization operates on centuries)
- **Monoculture risk** in AI safety thinking leads to blindspots

---

## What I've Built (ERES Institute Framework)

### **The 1000-Year Future Map** (Published on ResearchGate)
- Four-era civilization roadmap (2025-3025) with measurable milestones
- Addresses AI alignment at multi-generational timescales
- Models Type 0→I→II Kardashev transitions with AI as catalyst

### **GAIA Governance System**
- Sociocratic coordination for conflicting stakeholder values
- Merit-based contribution tracking (could inform AI access/control)
- Real-time feedback loops (similar to Constitutional AI but for resource allocation)

### **Meritcoin/Jewel Economy**
- Energy-based currency addressing post-scarcity transitions
- Maintains human dignity/purpose alongside AI automation
- Scales from individual transactions to interstellar civilization

### **UBIMIA (Universal Basic Income Merit Integration)**
- Transition model for AI-driven economic disruption
- Contribution-based value systems where AI augments rather than replaces

### **ERES Education & EDF Defense Frameworks**
- Competency-based learning (EarnedPath) for rapid societal adaptation
- Existential risk mitigation with AI alignment as core threat vector

---

## Concrete Value I Add

### **Research Contributions**
- "Constitutional Economics" extending your Constitutional AI to resource allocation
- "Long-Horizon Alignment" applying 1000-Year methodology to AI development
- "Biofeedback-AI Integration" using wellness markers as alignment signals

### **Strategy & Policy**
- Translate AI safety research into governance frameworks policymakers can implement
- Design stakeholder coordination processes for AI deployment decisions
- Scenario planning for multiple AI development trajectories

### **Interdisciplinary Synthesis**
- Bring unconventional systems thinking to avoid monoculture blindspots
- Integrate biology, economics, governance, and technology perspectives
- Published research demonstrating ability to communicate complex ideas

## What I'm Seeking

**Role:** Research Scientist, Strategy & Foresight, or Policy & Partnerships position

**Environment:** Peer-group collaboration with intellectually curious professionals committed to beneficial AI

**Compensation:** Fair market rate (currently unpaid at ERES Institute)

**Mission Alignment:** Anthropic's Constitutional AI approach resonates deeply with ERES governance principles

---

## Why This Matters Now

- AI capabilities advancing faster than governance structures (window is narrow)
- Economic disruption beginning (unemployment, value creation shifts)
- Civilizational coordination failures (climate, pandemics) prove we need better systems
- First-mover advantage in shaping AI governance frameworks has enormous impact

**The 1000-year question:** Will AI transformation be catastrophic or graceful?

I've spent years building frameworks for the graceful path. Let's integrate them into Anthropic's mission.

## Next Steps

1. **30-minute exploratory call** to discuss potential fit
2. **Technical presentation** of ERES frameworks to relevant teams
3. **Collaboration pilot** to demonstrate value-add
