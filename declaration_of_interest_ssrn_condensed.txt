DECLARATION OF INTEREST STATEMENT

Author: Joseph A. Sprute
Title: Planetary Emergency Declaration - Preventing the 6th Mass Extinction
Submission to: SSRN

FINANCIAL INTERESTS:

Author is Founder/Director of ERES Institute for New Age Cybernetics (established February 2012, Bella Vista, Arkansas), a non-profit research organization. No external funding, grants, or compensation received for this work.

Author has clear interest in implementing proposed ERES frameworks (GSSG, BERA, VERTECA, PlayNAC, Storm Party, Vacationomics) at scale. All frameworks are open-source with no proprietary restrictions. Author commits to public publication of all specifications, models, and protocols regardless of adoption or compensation.

INSTITUTIONAL INTERESTS:

As ERES Institute founder, author's professional reputation is tied to framework validity and effectiveness. This incentivizes rigorous documentation and empirical verification. 300+ papers published on ResearchGate document 13+ years of transparent development.

INTELLECTUAL INTERESTS:

This paper represents 13+ years researching cybernetic systems, planetary coordination, and sustainable infrastructure. Deep intellectual investment in New Age Cybernetics as paradigm for complex civilizational challenges.

PERSONAL INTERESTS:

Author served in U.S. military and operates from principle "Don't hurt yourself, don't hurt others, build for generations to come." Strong personal motivation for planetary stewardship and long-term civilizational sustainability. Views 6th mass extinction prevention as moral imperative transcending professional or financial interests.

TRANSPARENCY COMMITMENTS:

Author commits to: open publication of all frameworks and specifications, public verification of empirical claims through VERTECA protocols, transparent documentation of future funding/partnerships, rigorous peer review and independent validation, no proprietary restrictions on implementation by others.

POTENTIAL CONFLICTS:

13+ years investment creates potential confirmation bias. Mitigation: frameworks include falsifiable predictions, VERTECA requires triple-redundant measurement, public dashboards enable independent verification, welcomes rigorous peer review and alternatives. Primary motivation is preventing planetary collapse, not financial gain. Frameworks designed to be self-funding, eliminating dependency on author's involvement.

BROADER CONTEXT:

Paper addresses urgent planetary crises (magnetic pole destabilization, biodiversity collapse, systems failure) threatening civilization and biosphere. Author believes 6th extinction preventable through coordinated infrastructure deployment but acknowledges other approaches may prove equally effective. Goal is catalyzing action at sufficient scale and speed, regardless of which frameworks deployed. No competing commercial interests benefiting from delayed action on climate change, biodiversity loss, or renewable energy transition.

DECLARATION:

I, Joseph A. Sprute, declare this statement accurately represents my interests related to this research. I commit to updating this declaration if circumstances change and maintaining transparency throughout future development or deployment. This work represents genuine effort to address existential planetary challenges, documented through 300+ papers and 13+ years of development. All claims subject to empirical verification. I welcome rigorous scientific scrutiny.
