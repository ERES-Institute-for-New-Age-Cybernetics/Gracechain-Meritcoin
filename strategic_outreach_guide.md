## Outreach Strategy

### **Phase 1: Cold Outreach (Weeks 1-2)**

**Target:** 10-15 people across research, policy, and strategy teams

**Method:**
- LinkedIn connection requests with personalized messages
- Direct emails (if publicly available)
- Comments/engagement on their published work

**Message Template:**
> "Hi [Name], I've been following your work on [specific paper/project] at Anthropic. I've developed complementary frameworks on AI governance and long-horizon alignment through the ERES Institute. Would you be open to a brief conversation about potential intersections? [Link to one-page summary]"

**Success metric:** 2-3 responses agreeing to calls

---

### **Phase 2: Warm Introductions (Weeks 2-4)**

**Leverage:**
- Do you know anyone in AI safety community? Ask for introductions
- Effective Altruism connections? Many overlap with Anthropic
- Academic advisors or colleagues? Cross-institutional connections

**Message Template (to connector):**
> "I've developed frameworks on AI governance that align closely with Anthropic's Constitutional AI work. Do you know anyone there who might be interested in a conversation? Happy to share my research summary."

**Success metric:** 1-2 warm introductions

---

### **Phase 3: Formal Application (Weeks 3-4)**

**Apply to:**
- Research Scientist roles (even if not perfect match)
- Policy Researcher roles
- Any "Strategy" or "Foresight" roles

**In application:**
- Attach full proposal document
- Reference any conversations from Phase 1/2
- Emphasize unique perspective (not just technical skills)

**Cover letter focus:**
- "I bring 1000-year timescale thinking to your AI safety mission"
- "My published frameworks address gaps in current AI governance research"
- "Seeking peer-group environment to evolve these ideas gracefully"

**Success metric:** Application reviewed, invited to interview

---

### **Phase 4: Persistence (Ongoing)**

**If no immediate response:**
- Follow up after 2 weeks (polite nudge)
- Continue publishing research (build credibility)
- Engage with Anthropic's public work (thoughtful comments)
- Network at AI safety events (organic connections)

**Timeline:** This process could take 3-6 months. Stay patient but persistent.

## Key Messaging Points (Regardless of Contact)

### **Always emphasize:**
1. **Mission alignment** - You share Anthropic's commitment to beneficial AI
2. **Novel perspective** - You bring unconventional systems thinking (avoid blindspots)
3. **Published research** - You've demonstrated capability through ResearchGate work
4. **Practical frameworks** - Not just theory—you have implementable governance models
5. **Peer collaboration** - You want to evolve ideas with professionals, not work in isolation

### **Avoid:**
1. Sounding desperate for employment (even though you need it)
2. Overselling ("This will revolutionize everything!")
3. Being vague ("I have some interesting ideas...")
4. Demanding attention ("You need to hear this!")
5. Generic messaging (customize every outreach)

## Backup Plan: Adjacent Organizations

If Anthropic doesn't work out immediately, consider parallel outreach to:

### **AI Safety Organizations**
- OpenAI (Safety Team)
- DeepMind (Ethics & Society)
- Alignment Research Center
- Redwood Research
- Center for AI Safety

### **Think Tanks & Policy Orgs**
- Future of Humanity Institute
- Center for Security and Emerging Technology (CSET)
- Partnership on AI
- AI Now Institute

### **Academic Labs**
- Stanford HAI (Human-Centered AI)
- MIT Media Lab
- Berkeley CHAI (Center for Human-Compatible AI)
- Any university with AI governance programs

**Strategy:** Position ERES frameworks as research contributions, seek postdoc or visiting scholar roles
