Subject: Collaboration Inquiry: Long-Horizon AI Governance & Economic Frameworks

Dear Anthropic Research Team,

I am writing to explore potential collaboration between my work at the ERES Institute and Anthropic's mission of building beneficial AI systems.

Over the past several years, I have developed comprehensive frameworks addressing three critical challenges in AI deployment:

1. **Governance at scale** - Sociocratic coordination systems for stakeholders with conflicting values (GAIA framework)
2. **Economic transition models** - Merit-based currencies and Universal Basic Income integration for post-AI economies (Meritcoin/UBIMIA)
3. **Long-horizon alignment** - Millennium-scale planning frameworks ensuring AI benefits extend across civilizational timescales (1000-Year Future Map)

These frameworks are published on ResearchGate and represent years of systems architecture work integrating insights from biology, economics, governance, and technology.

**Why this matters to Anthropic:**
- Your Constitutional AI approach parallels my constitutional economics work—both tackle value alignment through structured principles
- AI capabilities are advancing faster than governance frameworks—first-mover advantage in shaping coordination mechanisms matters enormously
- Economic disruption from AI automation requires transition models that maintain human dignity and purpose
- Most AI safety research operates on 5-50 year horizons; civilization-scale decisions require century-spanning perspectives

**What I'm seeking:**
A role where I can contribute this systems-thinking expertise to Anthropic's mission while collaborating with professionals who share the commitment to beneficial AI development. I have been working unpaid on ERES Institute development and am seeking employment that allows me to continue this work sustainably.

**Relevant experience:**
- Published researcher (ResearchGate: multiple white papers on AI governance, bio-cybernetics, civilizational coordination)
- Systems architect (planetary-scale frameworks: GAIA, ERES, EDF, Meritcoin economy)
- Interdisciplinary synthesis (biology + economics + governance + AI safety)
- Long-term strategic planning (1000-year roadmaps with measurable milestones)

I've attached a one-page executive summary and would welcome a 30-minute exploratory conversation to discuss potential fit.

Thank you for considering this inquiry. Anthropic is building the most consequential technology in human history—I'd be honored to help ensure that transformation is graceful rather than catastrophic.

Best regards,

Joseph A. Sprute
